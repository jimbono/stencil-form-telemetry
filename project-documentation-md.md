## Overview

This project implements an address form component with advanced telemetry capabilities using Stencil. It demonstrates how to effectively collect user behavior data while maintaining high performance and scalability.

## Key Components

### 1. Address Form Component (`address-form.tsx`)

The main component that renders the address form and collects user interactions.

Key features:
- Renders input fields for name, street, city, state, and zip code
- Emits telemetry events for field blur and form submission
- Uses Stencil's lifecycle methods for component mount/unmount tracking

### 2. Telemetry Service (`telemetry-service.ts`)

A singleton service that manages telemetry event processing.

Key features:
- Implements a global event bus using CustomEvents
- Provides methods for emitting telemetry events
- Handles event sampling based on configurable rates

### 3. Telemetry Batcher (`telemetry-batcher.ts`)

Manages the batching and sending of telemetry events.

Key features:
- Buffers events up to a configurable batch size
- Implements a flush interval for timely data transmission
- Compresses data using Pako before sending

## Telemetry Implementation Details

### Event Types

1. `componentMount`: Emitted when a component is mounted
2. `componentUnmount`: Emitted when a component is unmounted
3. `fieldBlur`: Emitted when a form field loses focus
4. `formSubmit`: Emitted when the form is submitted

### Sampling Strategy

Configurable sampling rates are implemented in `TelemetryService`:

```typescript
private shouldSampleEvent(eventType: string): boolean {
  const samplingRates = {
    'formSubmit': 1,    // 100% sampling
    'fieldBlur': 0.1,   // 10% sampling
    'default': 0.5      // 50% sampling
  };
  const rate = samplingRates[eventType] || samplingRates['default'];
  return Math.random() < rate;
}
```

### Data Flow

1. Components emit events using `telemetry.emit()`
2. Events are captured by the global event listener in `TelemetryService`
3. Events are sampled and added to the `TelemetryBatcher`
4. `TelemetryBatcher` accumulates events and periodically sends them in batches

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Event Batching**: Reduces the number of network requests by grouping events.
2. **Data Compression**: Minimizes payload size using Pako compression.
3. **Sampling**: Reduces data volume while maintaining statistical significance.
4. **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses `CustomEvents` for non-blocking operations.

## Extensibility

The current implementation can be easily extended to:

1. Add new event types by emitting new event names from components
2. Implement more sophisticated sampling strategies in `TelemetryService`
3. Extend the `TelemetryBatcher` to handle different types of data or transmission methods

## Testing

To implement unit tests for the telemetry system:

1. Test `TelemetryService` for correct event emission and sampling
2. Test `TelemetryBatcher` for correct batching behavior and compression
3. Use Stencil's testing utilities to verify component-level telemetry in `AddressForm`

Example test for `TelemetryService`:

```typescript
import { TelemetryService } from './telemetry-service';

describe('TelemetryService', () => {
  it('should emit events correctly', () => {
    const telemetry = TelemetryService.getInstance();
    const spy = jest.spyOn(document, 'dispatchEvent');
    
    telemetry.emit('testEvent', { data: 'test' });
    
    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.any(CustomEvent));
    expect(spy.mock.calls[0][0].detail).toEqual({
      type: 'testEvent',
      timestamp: expect.any(String),
      data: { data: 'test' }
    });
  });
});
```

## Deployment Considerations

1. Ensure the server endpoint for receiving telemetry data is set up and can handle the expected data format
2. Consider implementing a queuing system on the server to handle high volumes of incoming telemetry data
3. Set up monitoring for the telemetry system to track its performance and reliability

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement real-time analytics dashboard for visualizing telemetry data
2. Add support for A/B testing by extending the telemetry system
3. Implement user session tracking for more contextualized telemetry data
