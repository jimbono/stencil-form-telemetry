## Overview

This project implements an address form component with advanced telemetry capabilities using Stencil. It demonstrates how to effectively collect user behavior data while maintaining high performance and scalability, with a focus on comprehensive component lifecycle tracking.

## Key Components

### 1. Address Form Component (`address-form.tsx`)

The main component that renders the address form and collects user interactions.

Key features:
- Renders input fields for name, street, city, state, and zip code
- Emits telemetry events for component lifecycle, field blur, and form submission
- Uses Stencil's lifecycle methods and IntersectionObserver for comprehensive tracking

### 2. App Root Component (`app-root.tsx`)

The root component of the application.

Key features:
- Provides the main structure of the application
- Demonstrates telemetry implementation at the application root level
- Tracks its own lifecycle and visibility events

### 3. Telemetry Service (`telemetry-service.ts`)

A singleton service that manages telemetry event processing.

Key features:
- Implements a global event bus using CustomEvents
- Provides methods for emitting telemetry events
- Handles event sampling based on configurable rates

### 4. Telemetry Batcher (`telemetry-batcher.ts`)

Manages the batching and sending of telemetry events.

Key features:
- Buffers events up to a configurable batch size
- Implements a flush interval for timely data transmission
- Compresses data using Pako before sending

### 5. Telemetry Types (`telemetry-types.ts`)

Defines the structure of telemetry events and event types.

Key features:
- Provides a TypeScript interface for telemetry events
- Defines an enum for all telemetry event types

## Telemetry Implementation Details

### Event Types

1. `ComponentMount`: Emitted when a component is mounted
2. `ComponentRender`: Emitted when a component finishes rendering
3. `ComponentVisible`: Emitted when a component becomes visible in the viewport
4. `ComponentUnmount`: Emitted when a component is unmounted
5. `FieldBlur`: Emitted when a form field loses focus
6. `FormSubmit`: Emitted when the form is submitted

### Sampling Strategy

Configurable sampling rates are implemented in `TelemetryService`:

```typescript
private shouldSampleEvent(eventType: string): boolean {
  const samplingRates = {
    [TelemetryEventType.FormSubmit]: 1,    // 100% sampling
    [TelemetryEventType.FieldBlur]: 0.1,   // 10% sampling
    [TelemetryEventType.ComponentRender]: 0.5, // 50% sampling
    [TelemetryEventType.ComponentVisible]: 0.5, // 50% sampling
    'default': 0.5      // 50% sampling
  };
  const rate = samplingRates[eventType] || samplingRates['default'];
  return Math.random() < rate;
}
```

### Data Flow

1. Components emit events using `telemetry.emit()`
2. Events are captured by the global event listener in `TelemetryService`
3. Events are sampled and added to the `TelemetryBatcher`
4. `TelemetryBatcher` accumulates events and periodically sends them in batches

### Visibility Tracking

Components use IntersectionObserver to track when they become visible:

```typescript
private observeVisibility() {
  this.intersectionObserver = new IntersectionObserver(
    (entries) => {
      entries.forEach((entry) => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
          telemetry.emit(TelemetryEventType.ComponentVisible, { 
            name: 'ComponentName',
            visibleTime: performance.now()
          });
          this.intersectionObserver.disconnect();
        }
      });
    },
    { threshold: 0.5 }
  );

  this.intersectionObserver.observe(this.el);
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Event Batching**: Reduces the number of network requests by grouping events.
2. **Data Compression**: Minimizes payload size using Pako compression.
3. **Sampling**: Reduces data volume while maintaining statistical significance.
4. **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses `CustomEvents` for non-blocking operations.
5. **Efficient Visibility Tracking**: Uses IntersectionObserver for performant visibility detection.

## Extensibility

The current implementation can be easily extended to:

1. Add new event types by updating the `TelemetryEventType` enum and emitting new event types from components
2. Implement more sophisticated sampling strategies in `TelemetryService`
3. Extend the `TelemetryBatcher` to handle different types of data or transmission methods
4. Add new components with built-in telemetry by following the patterns in `address-form.tsx` and `app-root.tsx`

## Testing

To implement unit tests for the telemetry system:

1. Test `TelemetryService` for correct event emission and sampling
2. Test `TelemetryBatcher` for correct batching behavior and compression
3. Use Stencil's testing utilities to verify component-level telemetry in `AddressForm` and `AppRoot`
4. Test visibility tracking using mock IntersectionObserver implementations

## Deployment Considerations

1. Ensure the server endpoint for receiving telemetry data is set up and can handle the expected data format
2. Consider implementing a queuing system on the server to handle high volumes of incoming telemetry data
3. Set up monitoring for the telemetry system to track its performance and reliability
4. Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) when collecting and processing telemetry data

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement real-time analytics dashboard for visualizing telemetry data
2. Add support for A/B testing by extending the telemetry system
3. Implement user session tracking for more contextualized telemetry data
4. Develop a system for dynamically updating sampling rates based on current system load or data importance
5. Integrate machine learning models for predictive analytics based on collected telemetry data
