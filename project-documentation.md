## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive financial services dashboard with advanced telemetry capabilities using Stencil. It demonstrates how to effectively collect user behavior data and business metrics while maintaining high performance and scalability, with a focus on component lifecycle tracking and extensibility.

## Key Components

1. **Trade Order Entry Component** (`trade-order-entry.tsx`): Renders the trade order form, collects user interactions, and tracks order completion time and frequently traded symbols.
2. **Address Form Component** (`address-form.tsx`): Collects user address information with telemetry tracking.
3. **User Profile Component** (`user-profile.tsx`): Displays and allows editing of user information, demonstrating advanced telemetry integration.
4. **Custom Dropdown Component** (`custom-dropdown.tsx`): Reusable dropdown component used across the dashboard.
5. **Custom Input Component** (`custom-input.tsx`): Reusable input component used across the dashboard.
6. **App Root Component** (`app-root.tsx`): Provides the main structure of the application and integrates other components.
7. **Telemetry Service** (`telemetry-service.ts`): Manages telemetry event processing and sampling.
8. **Telemetry Batcher** (`telemetry-batcher.ts`): Handles batching and sending of telemetry events.
9. **Telemetry Types** (`telemetry-types.ts`): Defines structures and types for telemetry events and user data.
10. **Mock User Service** (`mock-user-service.ts`): Provides a mock implementation of the UserService interface for testing and development purposes.

## Telemetry Implementation Details

### Event Types

```typescript
export enum TelemetryEventType {
  ComponentMount = 'componentMount',
  ComponentRender = 'componentRender',
  ComponentVisible = 'componentVisible',
  ComponentUnmount = 'componentUnmount',
  FieldBlur = 'fieldBlur',
  FormSubmit = 'formSubmit',
  UserInteraction = 'userInteraction',
  PerformanceMetric = 'performanceMetric',
  ErrorOccurred = 'errorOccurred',
  FormCompletionTime = 'formCompletionTime',
  TradeOrderStarted = 'tradeOrderStarted',
  TradeOrderCompleted = 'tradeOrderCompleted',
  SymbolEntered = 'symbolEntered',
  FrequentSymbolsTracked = 'frequentSymbolsTracked'
}
```

### Sampling Strategy

Configurable sampling rates are implemented in `TelemetryService`:

```typescript
private samplingRates: { [key: string]: number } = {
  [TelemetryEventType.FormSubmit]: 1,
  [TelemetryEventType.FieldBlur]: 0.1,
  [TelemetryEventType.ComponentRender]: 0.5,
  [TelemetryEventType.ComponentVisible]: 0.5,
  [TelemetryEventType.UserInteraction]: 0.2,
  [TelemetryEventType.PerformanceMetric]: 1,
  [TelemetryEventType.ErrorOccurred]: 1,
  [TelemetryEventType.FormCompletionTime]: 1,
  [TelemetryEventType.TradeOrderCompleted]: 1,
  [TelemetryEventType.SymbolEntered]: 0.5,
  'default': 0.5
};
```

### Data Flow

1. Components emit events using `telemetry.emit()`
2. Events are captured by the global event listener in `TelemetryService`
3. Events are sampled based on configurable rates
4. Sampled events are added to the `TelemetryBatcher`
5. `TelemetryBatcher` accumulates events and periodically sends them in batches

## Business Events

1. **Trade Order Completion Time**: Tracks the time taken to complete a trade order.
2. **Frequently Traded Symbols**: Monitors and reports symbols that are frequently traded.
3. **Form Completion Time**: Measures the time taken to complete various forms (Address, User Profile).
4. **User Profile Updates**: Tracks when and how often users update their profile information.

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Event Batching**: Reduces network requests by grouping events.
2. **Data Compression**: Minimizes payload size using Pako compression.
3. **Configurable Sampling**: Reduces data volume while maintaining statistical significance.
4. **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses `CustomEvents` for non-blocking operations.
5. **Efficient Visibility Tracking**: Uses IntersectionObserver for performant visibility detection.

## Styling and Responsive Design

- Consistent styling across all components using CSS files for each component.
- Responsive grid layout in the app-root component for organizing main components.
- Media queries for adapting to different screen sizes.
- Use of CSS variables for easy theming and maintenance.

## Extensibility Features

1. **Dynamic Sampling Rates**: The `TelemetryService` allows dynamic adjustment of sampling rates.
2. **Extended Event Types**: Includes a wide range of event types for comprehensive tracking.
3. **Reusable Components**: Custom input and dropdown components for consistency and easy extension.
4. **Mock Services**: Includes a MockUserService for easy testing and development.

## Testing

Implement unit tests for:
1. TelemetryService for correct event emission, sampling, and rate adjustment
2. TelemetryBatcher for correct batching, compression, and retry logic
3. Individual components (TradeOrderEntry, AddressForm, UserProfile) for correct rendering and event emissions
4. Custom input and dropdown components
5. MockUserService

Implement integration tests for:
1. Interaction between components and the telemetry system
2. End-to-end user flows (e.g., completing a trade order, updating user profile)

## Deployment Considerations

1. Set up a robust server endpoint to handle telemetry data ingestion
2. Implement a queuing system for high-volume data processing
3. Ensure proper error handling and logging on the server side
4. Set up monitoring for the telemetry system to track performance and reliability
5. Implement data retention and purging policies in compliance with data protection regulations
6. Consider using a time-series database for efficient storage and querying of telemetry data
7. Ensure the analytics backend can process and analyze all types of events effectively
8. Implement proper security measures for handling sensitive user data

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement real-time analytics dashboard for visualizing telemetry data
2. Add support for A/B testing by extending the telemetry system
3. Implement user session tracking for more contextualized telemetry data
4. Develop a system for dynamically updating sampling rates based on current system load or data importance
5. Integrate machine learning models for predictive analytics based on collected telemetry data
6. Implement a plugin system to allow easy addition of custom telemetry processors
7. Create a configuration UI for adjusting telemetry settings in real-time
8. Implement real backend integration for the Trade Order Entry and User Profile components
9. Add more interactive features to the dashboard components
10. Implement heat mapping of user interactions within forms to identify areas of focus or confusion
11. Develop a system for correlating business metrics (e.g., trade completion times with market volatility)
12. Create a mechanism for dynamically adjusting UI based on telemetry data to optimize user experience
13. Implement multi-factor authentication for enhanced security
14. Add support for multiple languages and localization
