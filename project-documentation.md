## Overview

This project implements an address form and user profile component with advanced telemetry capabilities using Stencil. It demonstrates how to effectively collect user behavior data and business metrics while maintaining high performance and scalability, with a focus on comprehensive component lifecycle tracking and extensibility.

## Key Components

1. **Address Form Component** (`address-form.tsx`): Renders the address form, collects user interactions, and tracks form completion time.
2. **User Profile Component** (`user-profile.tsx`): Displays user information, allows editing of user data, and demonstrates advanced telemetry integration.
3. **App Root Component** (`app-root.tsx`): Provides the main structure of the application and integrates other components.
4. **Telemetry Service** (`telemetry-service.ts`): Manages telemetry event processing and sampling.
5. **Telemetry Batcher** (`telemetry-batcher.ts`): Handles batching and sending of telemetry events.
6. **Telemetry Types** (`telemetry-types.ts`): Defines structures and types for telemetry events and user data.
7. **Mock User Service** (`mock-user-service.ts`): Provides a mock implementation of the UserService interface for testing and development purposes.

## Telemetry Implementation Details

### Event Types

```typescript
export enum TelemetryEventType {
  ComponentMount = 'componentMount',
  ComponentRender = 'componentRender',
  ComponentVisible = 'componentVisible',
  ComponentUnmount = 'componentUnmount',
  FieldBlur = 'fieldBlur',
  FormSubmit = 'formSubmit',
  UserInteraction = 'userInteraction',
  PerformanceMetric = 'performanceMetric',
  ErrorOccurred = 'errorOccurred',
  FormCompletionTime = 'formCompletionTime',
  ProfileEditStarted = 'profileEditStarted',
  ProfileUpdated = 'profileUpdated'
}
```

### Sampling Strategy

Configurable sampling rates are implemented in `TelemetryService`:

```typescript
private samplingRates: { [key: string]: number } = {
  [TelemetryEventType.FormSubmit]: 1,
  [TelemetryEventType.FieldBlur]: 0.1,
  [TelemetryEventType.ComponentRender]: 0.5,
  [TelemetryEventType.ComponentVisible]: 0.5,
  [TelemetryEventType.UserInteraction]: 0.2,
  [TelemetryEventType.PerformanceMetric]: 1,
  [TelemetryEventType.ErrorOccurred]: 1,
  [TelemetryEventType.FormCompletionTime]: 1,
  [TelemetryEventType.ProfileEditStarted]: 1,
  [TelemetryEventType.ProfileUpdated]: 1,
  'default': 0.5
};
```

### Data Flow

1. Components emit events using `telemetry.emit()`
2. Events are captured by the global event listener in `TelemetryService`
3. Events are sampled based on configurable rates
4. Sampled events are added to the `TelemetryBatcher`
5. `TelemetryBatcher` accumulates events and periodically sends them in batches

## Business Events

### Form Completion Time

We track the time it takes for a user to complete the address form submission. This is implemented in the `AddressForm` component.

### User Profile Interactions

We track various interactions with the User Profile component:

1. **Edit Mode Entered**: Tracked when a user starts editing their profile.
2. **Profile Updated**: Tracked when a user successfully saves their updated profile information.
3. **Field Edited**: Tracked when a user edits a specific field in their profile.

These events provide insights into:
- How frequently users update their profiles
- Which fields are most commonly updated
- The success rate of profile update attempts

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Event Batching**: Reduces network requests by grouping events.
2. **Data Compression**: Minimizes payload size using Pako compression.
3. **Configurable Sampling**: Reduces data volume while maintaining statistical significance.
4. **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses `CustomEvents` for non-blocking operations.
5. **Efficient Visibility Tracking**: Uses IntersectionObserver for performant visibility detection.

## Extensibility Features

1. **Dynamic Sampling Rates**: The `TelemetryService` allows dynamic adjustment of sampling rates.
2. **Extended Event Types**: Includes a wide range of event types for comprehensive tracking.
3. **Dependency Injection**: The `UserProfile` component demonstrates dependency injection with `UserService`.
4. **Global Styles**: Uses global styles for consistent styling across components.
5. **Business Metric Tracking**: Easily extendable to track additional business-specific metrics.
6. **Interactive User Profile**: The UserProfile component supports editing, demonstrating how to track more complex user interactions.
7. **Mock Services**: Includes a MockUserService for easy testing and development.

## Testing

To implement unit tests for the telemetry system:

1. Test `TelemetryService` for correct event emission, sampling, and rate adjustment
2. Test `TelemetryBatcher` for correct batching, compression, and retry logic
3. Use Stencil's testing utilities to verify component-level telemetry in all components
4. Test visibility tracking using mock IntersectionObserver implementations
5. For `AddressForm` component:
   - Test form completion time calculation
   - Verify correct emission of FormCompletionTime events
   - Test edge cases like rapid form submissions
6. For `UserProfile` component:
   - Test edit mode entry and exit
   - Verify correct emission of ProfileEditStarted and ProfileUpdated events
   - Test individual field edits and corresponding telemetry events
   - Test error handling during profile updates
   - Verify that the component correctly updates its state after a successful profile update
7. For `MockUserService`:
   - Test getUserData method for both existing and non-existing users
   - Test updateUserData method for successful updates and error cases

## Deployment Considerations

1. Set up a robust server endpoint to handle telemetry data ingestion
2. Implement a queuing system for high-volume data processing
3. Ensure proper error handling and logging on the server side
4. Set up monitoring for the telemetry system to track performance and reliability
5. Implement data retention and purging policies in compliance with data protection regulations
6. Consider using a time-series database for efficient storage and querying of telemetry data
7. Ensure the analytics backend can process and analyze all types of events effectively
8. Implement proper security measures for handling user data in the UserProfile component

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement a real-time analytics dashboard for visualizing telemetry data
2. Add support for A/B testing by extending the telemetry system
3. Implement user session tracking for more contextualized telemetry data
4. Develop a system for dynamically updating sampling rates based on current system load or data importance
5. Integrate machine learning models for predictive analytics based on collected telemetry data
6. Implement a plugin system to allow easy addition of custom telemetry processors
7. Create a configuration UI for adjusting telemetry settings in real-time
8. Implement real backend integration for the UserService
9. Add more interactive features to the UserProfile component
10. Extend telemetry to track user behavior across multiple components in a micro frontend architecture
11. Implement advanced analytics on form completion times to identify usability issues or areas for improvement in the form design
12. Add more granular timing metrics, such as time spent on individual fields or sections of the form
13. Implement heat mapping of user interactions within forms to identify areas of focus or confusion
14. Develop a system for correlating form completion times with other business metrics (e.g., conversion rates)
15. Create a mechanism for dynamically adjusting form fields based on telemetry data to optimize user experience
16. Implement profile picture upload functionality in the UserProfile component
17. Add form validation to the profile editing feature
18. Implement undo/redo functionality for profile edits with corresponding telemetry tracking
19. Add more sophisticated error handling and user feedback in the UserProfile component
20. Implement data synchronization mechanisms for offline support in the UserProfile component
